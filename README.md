#Data Analysis with Python - freeCodeCamp Projects
This repository contains my solutions to the 5 projects required for the Data Analysis with Python certification from freeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates practical data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

##Projects Included:
###Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Computes summary statistics for a 3x3 matrix using NumPy.

###Demographic Data Analyzer
Analyzes demographic data using Pandas to answer questions about education, income, and more.

###Medical Data Visualizer
Visualizes medical examination data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore relationships between variables.

###Page View Time Series Visualizer
Analyzes and visualizes time series data of Wikipedia page views using Pandas and Matplotlib.

###Sea Level Predictor
Predicts future sea level rise using linear regression with SciPy and Matplotlib.

##Skills Demonstrated:
###Data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas

###Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

###Statistical analysis with NumPy and SciPy

###Problem-solving and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

This repository showcases my ability to analyze and visualize data effectively using Python, as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
